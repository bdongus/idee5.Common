# idee5.EventStoreLite
Simple event store implementation using CQRSLite and EFCore.

Sometimes an application is designed with DDD, CQRS and/or event sourcing in mind but it is not (yet) big enough to justify a distributed infrastructure.


In those cases a lightweight, but extensible, path might be a good start.Which is the purpose of this library.
